Hi, I'm Xuanyu Liu. I am a second-year master's student in the <a href='https://www.si.umich.edu/'>School of Information</a> at the University of Michigan. During my master, I had the honor of learning from and collaborating with leading HCI researchers, including <a href='https://www.gabrielamarcu.com/'>Dr. Gabriela Marcu</a>, <a href='https://yardi.people.si.umich.edu/'>Prof. Sarita Schoenebeck</a>, and <a href='https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~profdj/'>Dr. Dhruv Jain</a> at the University of Michigan; <a href='https://zhenbai.io/'>Dr. Zhen Bai</a> at the University of Rochester; <a href='https://raylc.org/'>Dr. Ray LC</a> at the City University of Hong Kong; and <a href='https://www.fed.cuhk.edu.hk/eps/en/peoples/prof-so-wing-chee-catherine/'>Prof. Wing-chee So</a> at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Prior to joining UMich, I obtained my bachelor's degree at the University College London, advised by <a href='https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/30634-aneesha-singh'>Dr. Aneesha Singh</a>.

As a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researcher, my research aims to examine how technology can genuinely support marginalized communities. I'm particularly focused on developing inclusive design approaches that center users as experts in their own experiences.
